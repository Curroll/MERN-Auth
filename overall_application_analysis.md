# Overall Application Analysis

## Authentication Controller (`authController.js`)
- **Functions**:
  - **register**: Handles user registration, including input validation, password hashing, JWT generation, and sending a welcome email.
  - **login**: Manages user login, including email/password validation and JWT generation.
  - **logout**: Clears the authentication token from cookies.
  - **sendVerifyOtp**: Sends an OTP to the user's email for account verification.
  - **verifyEmail**: Verifies the user's email using the provided OTP.
  - **isAuthenticated**: Checks if the user is authenticated.
  - **resetPasswordOtp**: Sends an OTP for password reset.
  - **resetPassword**: Resets the user's password using the provided OTP.

## Middleware (`userAuth.js`)
- **Functionality**: 
  - Verifies the JWT token from cookies to authenticate users.
  - Sets the user ID in the request object if the token is valid; otherwise, returns an unauthorized response.

## Context Management (`appContext.jsx`)
- **Functionality**:
  - Manages application state related to user authentication and data.
  - Uses Axios to fetch authentication state and user data from the backend.
  - Provides loading states and error handling through toast notifications.

## Next Steps
- Review the client-side components that interact with the authentication context to ensure they handle user states correctly.
- Check the routes in the server to ensure they are protected by the authentication middleware where necessary.
- Test the application to verify that the authentication flow works as expected, including registration, login, logout, email verification, and password reset.
